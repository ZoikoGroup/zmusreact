                            <AccordionBody>Wi-Fi Calling, also known as Voice over Wi-Fi (or VoWiFi), is a predefined feature on most smartphones that lets you make and receive video &amp; voice calls, texts, and video calls to the nearby strongest Wi-Fi network instead of using a regular cellular network.</AccordionBody>

                            <AccordionHeader>Are Wi-Fi Calls free?</AccordionHeader>
                            <AccordionBody>Mostly no. The fees or charges for making Wi-Fi calls instead of cellular network phone calls are not free. Operators are mostly treated as regular calls from your selected plan. Please note, that certain public Wi-fi networks demand FEEs to access their network, which will cost your phone bills as well. If you don&apos;t have an active current plan and are unable to make calls from your cell phone, you will most likely need to recharge and activate Wi-Fi calling to make calls on your phone.</AccordionBody>
