However, shipping time may vary in remote or rural areas, and it will take longer than regular delivery times to reach your destination.<br />Please note that standard delivery times in certain areas typically take longer anywhere from 7 to 12 business days, due to certain areas-imposed restrictions on local regulations or conditions, and delivery times may vary.</p>
